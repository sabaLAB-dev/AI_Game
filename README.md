ðŸ§  AI-Driven Learning: Teaching a Computer Multiplication Through Pattern Recognition, Not Calculation! #MachineLearning

Post Content

I'm excited to share the release of my latest project: the Smart Multiplication AI Game! ðŸš€

This isn't your typical calculator app. I  (with my parents help) built an educational tool using a Polynomial Regression algorithm to mimic how a small child with high pattern recognition skills would learn multiplicationâ€” only by observation and guesswork, not by knowing the rules beforehand like a calculator. It's a fantastic, interactive demonstration of Machine Learning principles in action.

The Goal: Train an AI model by providing examples (e.g., 2Ã—3=6).

The Outcome: The AI learns the underlying mathematical pattern, allowing it to predict the results of new problems with impressive accuracy.

Whether you're an educator, a developer, or just curious about AI in educational technology, check out the project and the Windows executable on GitHub.
